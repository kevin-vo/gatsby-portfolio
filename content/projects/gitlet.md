A portable version control system that is powered by Java. If for whatever reason you can't install git on your machine, gitlet works anywhere and supports the important local git commands. Just put gitlet in any working directory and you're good to go. No installation required.

Compatible commands: init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log, find, status, branch, rm-branch, reset, merge.
