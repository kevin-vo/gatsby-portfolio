Enter Empty Mourning, a site created for a local garage band. It features access to all their music streaming outlets, show dates, and recent music videos. The page also displays a live photo feed using the Instagram API.

Empty Mourning was an exercise to see how far vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS could be pushed. We eventually bootstrapped our project with React to see how easy it was to implement a nav bar (spoilers, it was a lot easier). Though the project unfortunately never saw itself through to the end, this project showed us the power of a frontend framework (through its lack thereof!).
