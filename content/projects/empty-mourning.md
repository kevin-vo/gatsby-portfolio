Enter Empty Mourning, a site created for a local garage band. It features access to all their music streaming outlets, show dates, and recent music videos. The page also displays a live photo feed using the Instagram API.

Empty Mourning was an exercise to see how far vanilla html, css, and JS could be pushed... until we cheated and used JQuery and React for the navbar. Though the project unfortunately never saw itself through to the end, this project demonstrated the power of a frontend framework (through its lack thereof!).
